Lessons Learned of Undergraduate Research"></a>Research Or Not? Lessons Learned of Undergraduate Research</h1><p>Research or not, that is a question. </p>
<p>On hearing those fancy experiences shared by peers who successfully advance in research or application to universities in foreign countries, one may ask himself: Fancy as it sound, should I do research in my undergraduate years? Should I pursue a MS degree or PhD degree?</p>
<p>Such discussions have been seemingly more of a cliche, and many established or amateur doctors or Professors have already written great number of articles discussing the pros and cons of pursuing a PhD. These articles, however, usually adopt a third-person view by telling personal experiences and listing elements, trying to make evenhanded comparisons, with a lack of a point-of-view from an undergraduate student, who is in turn the actual group of people in thirst for a heartfelt suggestion on whether go for PhD or not. Therefore in this passage, I want to change the narrative by adopting a first-person tone to share my experiences and introduce the lessons I have learned on my decision making process, hoping to introduce this ‘game of the few’, to the amateur fellow students.</p>
<p>Prior to my introduction, I sincerely recommend a book called <em>The Ph.D. Grind</em>, written by Phillip.J.Guo, Assistant Professor in UCSD.</p>
