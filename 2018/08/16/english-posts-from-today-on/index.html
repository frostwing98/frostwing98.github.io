        <h1 id="English-Posts-from-Today-On"><a href="#English-Posts-from-Today-On" class="headerlink" title="English Posts from Today On"></a>English Posts from Today On</h1><p>I hadbeen considering using English, a more wide-accepted language, to write down and publish my new posts.</p>
<p>Such ideas had been stronger and stronger after I returned back from University of Oxford, and University of Cambridge, where I met with lots of new friends. They said that they were, and are, really interested in me, and my major. It is indeed a pity, though, that it happened to be a personal website written in Chinese: but not anymore. </p>
<p>Moreover, during the days in UK, I became worried about my writing abilities. Although I have been quite confident in communicating with people fluently, my writing ability remained relatively weak. Then I came into a cool idea, that I will reorganize this lovely website, and adjust them in the favor of more friends from English-spoken countries or not, without the problems and barriers of languages. </p>
<p>This is also the initial reason why I set up this website. From today on, I am going to change this website into English, and from now on, most of the posts shall be written in English. </p>
