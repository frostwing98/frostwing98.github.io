It has wasn't quite easy to purchase a cheap flight ticket. As a student with minimum stipend, I decided to buy a ticket right to newark airport, and then get to NY by NJ Transit. Good news is, the train departs about every ten minutes. When I squezzed out from the crowded people in EWR, boarded the Air Tran to the railway station, the next train was right 3 minutes later.

First time to take a train in US, and there is no security check. The station is just a plain building with some decent glass corridors.
